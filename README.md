# Fibonacci

## Quick Start
Before starting, install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and Node.js
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/RichardFi/code-challenge-yongrui.git
```

```sh
$ cd fibonacci
$ node index.js
```

## Question 2
1. I may use React with functional component to implement a simple single-page-app. The implementation react app needs NPM for some basic initializations. The UI of web-based app will be clearer than the current terminal app.All the current functions can be reused in the new app, but part of the logic will be transferred to the react hooks of the functional component for better state management.

2. We do not usually deploy the terminal program, but if it is only for use, we can put this app on codesandbox or other similar apps, and users can simply play with it. If we implement this app to a react app, we can choose multiple deployment methods. The simplest and fastest deployment is to use Netlify cli. After building the app, we can deploy it directly to netlify. We can also push it to a GitHub repo for continuous deployment with settings. We can also dockerise and deploy the app in the cloud through AWS EC2 or other cloud service instances.

3. I think this code assessment is very good. It gives candidates enough freedom that they can complete the assessment in the way they like. The assessment is also very comprehensive, including algorithms (Fibonacci Number), functions (setInterval and clearInterval), and data structure (count frequency and sort). I would suggest that the assessment can be improved to more realistic. For example, this assessment can be about developing a Fibonacci calculator with basic functions.
